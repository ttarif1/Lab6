I\u2019ve made it so many times I almost know it by heart. I\u2019ve made it with fettuccine, angel hair, and orecchiette pasta. I\u2019ve made the sauce thinner and thicker with different spices and veggies. You really can\u2019t go wrong with this recipe. It\u2019s beautiful as is and is easy to add something new if you\u2019re up to it. The trick (for me) to cooking the pasta fully with the amount of wet ingredients is to cook low and slow. But even if cooking with medium/high heat it\u2019s fine. Just add some more broth and milk to the pan as needed. It really is the simplest one-pan meal ever and tastes great. Thanks for the recipe!","reviewRating":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Rating","ratingValue":5,"worstRating":1,"bestRating":5}},{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Review","datePublished":"2021-02-18","author":{"@context":"http://schema.org/","@type":"Person","name":"kar5145"},"reviewBody":"Easy, tasty and delicious!
